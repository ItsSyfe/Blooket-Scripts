# Blooket Scripts
Just simple scripts, might release source code later when bored.

Don't really give a fuck what you do with these scripts but they're heavily obfuscated so you might find it hard getting source from them (don't be like lawin use to be xD).


oh yeah to use them you just need to open raw on the script you want to use then ctrl + a and ctrl + c then go to blooket and paste the script into console (ctrl + shift + j)
